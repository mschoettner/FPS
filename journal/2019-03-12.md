Why did we take more slices? Because we can.
Where is our T2 for s01? Just measure again?
What is in the json file?

Measurements:
T1 structural
T2 structural


-it			interactive
--rm		remove
-v			mount volume
-s			subject identifier
-c			convert
touch		make file
-a			invisible files?
-b			BIDS

Data structure:
raw_data      DICOMS
BIDS          
derivatives   processed data

README: What did the study do
json: Task information

Python dictionary:
Key:Value

### Workflow:

1. Convert DICOM to BIDS
2. defacing (pydeface)
3. BIDS validator-> are the files in the right format?
4. quality check (mriqc)-> link
5. anatomical preprocessing

Docker commands as file to make a workflow -> fps_workflow.sh
load up output on github

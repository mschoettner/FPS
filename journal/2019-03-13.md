Heschel gyrus/ (find out alternative name)
- use that area to define ROI subdivision

Screenshot of every ROI that has been defined! for every participant

aseg segmentation  
- 4D files (3D in space, region)  
- give nipype information about parcellation number for ROI  
e.g. to use as mask for gray substance  
- hemisphere wise

Read up: Mindboggle, Freesurfer (slides online)
Freesurfer:
- subcortical segmentation
- cortical parcellation (ROIs)
- cortical surface reconstruction
  - boundaries gray/white matter
  - boundaries gray matter/CSF
  - cortical thickness
  

We need:
- fsl
- nipype
- nilearn

docker:
- uses bash files
